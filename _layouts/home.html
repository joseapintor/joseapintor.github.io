Hello! Jos√© here, I'm a junior developer that hails all the way from Spain to Austria in a search for knowledge and new challenges. After wrapping up my studies back in Spain and acquiring formal work experience for a year, I decided to chase something bigger so I decided to grab my suitcases and set sail to Austria. As of right now I'm trying my best to come to terms German, and share a roof with three rascally woofs. Currently I'm working on two passion projects: one using Unity and the other using Renpy, to get better at those prospective technologies and to share some fun with the world.
