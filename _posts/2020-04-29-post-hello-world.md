Welcome to my blog! In here you'll learn about the experiences of a Spanish developer, with a vision of a very small world, in the big Austria. (I didn't even seen snow before I got here!).

While I may not be the model Spanish-person one might expect me to be (I never played casta√±uelas for example...), I hope you get to enjoy this uncharted life of mine!

In the coming weeks I'll be sharing my experiences with this years GDCFP, volunteering for the local Women Techmakers chapter in Vienna, some funky stuff about international keyboard layouts, and some passion projects I've been coding up with my games studio co-founder.

Please look forward to it! Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
