Hello! Jos√© here, I'm a junior developer that hails all the way from Spain to Austria in a search for knowledge and new challenges.

After wrapping up my studies back in Spain and acquiring formal work experience for a year, I decided to chase something bigger so I decided to grab my suitcases set sail to Austria.

As of right now I'm trying my best to coming to terms with German, and sharing a roof with three woofs.

Currently I'm working on two passion projects: one using Unity and the other using Renpy, to get better at those prospective technologies and to share some fun with the world.
